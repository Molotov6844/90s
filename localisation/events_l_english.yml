 PRC.1.t:0 "Prominent Union Renegades Caught at Border"
 PRC.1.desc:0 "A border patrol was suprised when at around 11 PM last night a convoy of people attempted to cross the border in a retrofitted technical. While refugees from the Union are common due to the abhorrent conditions of those living there, it soon became apparent that these were no ordinary refugees. Upon arriving in Beijing under escort from trusted PLA members it was revealed that the refugee groups consisted of several major members of the Union's upper echelon, including Zhang Dejiang, the Chairman of Infastructure and Housing; Zhang Lianzhong, who was previously considered the Union's lead admiral; and Deng Xiaoping, a founder of the Union who while officaly having retired from politics still held a lot of political sway. While the exact reason that these people attempted to enter our nation has yet to be ascetained, this is sure to shock and humiliate the Union."
 PRC.1.a:0 "We will have to wait and see how this situation develops."
 PRC.2.t:0 "The Fate of the Renegades"
 PRC.2.desc:0 "Since their arrival in Beijing the Union refugees have been kept under close surveillance both to prevent their escape and for their own saftey. Against the wishes of othe party members, Zhang Chunqiao expressed his intent to have the refugees, dubbed renegades by the masses, tried for high treason. At the trial the renegades were made to read prepared speeches containing Maoist propaganda, although Deng Xiaoping deviated from his assigned speech and was forcibly removed from the courtroom. After several hours of largely theatrical proceedings, it has now come down to the judge to decide to adequate punishment, which will likely align with the wishes of the CCP."
 PRC.2.a:0 "Having been found guilty of high treason, the renegades are sentenced to death!"
 PRC.2.b:0 "It is best not to strain tensions with the Union too much, life imprisonment will suffice for now."
 PRC.2.c:0 "We must not upset the careful balance in the region, return the renegades to the Union."
 PRC.3.t:0 "Red Guard Demonstration Outside the Forbidden City"
 PRC.3.desc:0 "Thousands of Red Guards have gathered outside the Forbidden City to espouse their support for Mao Zedong. While Red Guard demonstrations are common, they often are points of tension between themselves and the army. The demonstration took a violent turn when Red Guard members entered the Forbidden City, which has stood since 1420 as a symbol of the glory days of the Chinese Empire and was repurposed as a museum in 1925, and began to destroy the palace grounds in the name of Mao. Outraged, citizens of Beijing and members of the People's Liberation Army's Beijing Garrison have arrived at the palace to stop the Guards. However, the Red Guards are an unoffical extension of the CCP and supressing their demonstration is bound to cause issues in the future."
 PRC.3.a:0 "The Forbidden City is an important part of our history and must be preserved!"
 PRC.3.b:0 "Hurrah for the Red Guard! The woeful symbol of the cruel emperors has finally been destroyed!"
 PRC.4.t:0 "Zhang Chunqiao Proclaims the Second Cultural Revolution"
 PRC.4.desc:0 "A air of fear has descended onto the CCP, and by extension the rest of the People's Republic when Zhang Chunqiao make an unexpected speech from the New Great Hall of the People (the old Great Hall having been destroyed in the nuclear blast that struck parts of Beijing in 1976). In the speech Zhang called for \"\a grave need to restructure Chinese society\"\ and to \"\crush the roots of capitalism that have once again taken hold\"\ He likened his request to the Cultural Revolution started by Mao decades earlier, and said that while it was largely sucessful, it had become apparent that a second one was needed. Already an issue, this new proclamation will likely put the Red Guard into a revolutionary fevor, and ordinary citizen and CCP member alike ought to be concerned over their saftey. While it may have a seemingly innocuous goal, Zhang will likely follow in Mao's footsteps and use the chaos as an opportunity to purge his political supporters and opponets alike."
 PRC.4.a:0 "It seems history truly is doomed to repeat itself."
 PRC.5.t:0 "Red Guard Members Gather in Shenyang"
 PRC.5.desc:0 "A large congregation of Red Guard members has gathered in central Shenyang. Among them is Wang Hongwen, a prominent member of the Red Guard who many believe is responsible for the orgination of the often violent protests conducted by the Red Guard. While the gathering is offically for a speech on the Second Cultural Revolution to be given by Wang, rumors have surfaced that Wang means to call for the arrest of various CCP members who he sees as detrimental to the revolution. While this could potentially be benefical, this would be a major increase in the Red Guard's power and could lead to issues in the future."
 PRC.5.a:0 "The are for the revolution are they not, why should we stop them?"
 PRC.5.b:0 "A rouge group like the Red Guards can not be allowed that degree of power."
 PRC.6.t:0 "People's Liberation Army Clashes with the Red Guard"
 PRC.6.desc:0 "Since the armstance signed in 1980 PLA divisons that fought in the civil war have been garrisoned in major cities to attempt to provide some degree of order. However, this has caused tensions with the increasingly militarized Red Guards who see the PLA as helping to aid in supressing the revolution. Ill will between the two has been festering for some time, and it manifested itself earlier today when the PLA forcibly supressed a Red Guard assembly. While no one appears to have been killed, several Red Guards appear to have been injured, and Red Guard leadership has called for the arrest of those responsible. This has put the CCP in an awkward posistion as the army is crucial to maintaining their rule, but if the Red Guard's demands are not met it could turn them against the government."
 PRC.6.a:0 "The soilders responsible must be detained along with their commanding officer."
 PRC.6.b:0 "We need the PLA's loyalty now more than ever, sweep this incident under the rug."
 PRC.7.t:0 "Qingdao Massacre"
 PRC.7.desc:0 "Tensions between the PLA and Red Guard have taken a turn for the worse after a violent confrentation during a Red Guard rally last night. Due to an estimated five thousand Red Guards having showed up for a series of speeches, including ones by Wang Hongwen and even Zhang Chunqiao himself; the mayor of Beijing requested PLA support to control the Guards. Vastly outnumbered by the Red Guard, it can be assumed that the PLA soliders were likely already jumpy, and it seems that they were ill prepared to mantain order admist such a large gathering of people. While it is uncertain as to what was the exact cause, a PLA soldier fired off a shot into the crowd, and the rest of the batallion followed. The Red Guards gathered there quickly dispersed, but it is estimated that at least 51 were killed and 186 injured along with three soilders being badly burned by a molotov cocktail thrown in retaliation. Both Wang and Zhang were safely escorted off the premises, and now Wang is calling for the CCP to take drastic action and \"\enact a sentence dishonorable death\"\ towards those responsible lest he \"\call upon his fellow revolutionaries to defend the ideals of Mao against the PLA menace\"\."
 PRC.7.a:0 "Execute the soldiers responsible."
 PRC.7.b:0 "Imprision the batallion as an example, but do not agree to Wang's demands."
 PRC.7.c:0 "The Red Guard are the ones at fault! Their cries for blood fall on deaf ears!"
 PRC.8.t:0 "Yantai Hydrocarbon Plant Destroyed"
 PRC.8.desc:0 "A major tenant of Maoism had always been the acceleration of rural industry to be on par with its urban counterparts. While this does not explicitly ban the creation of modern urban factories, many of the more extreme adherents of Maoism like the Red Guards view factories as a source of capitalist evil. That hatred was demonstrated today when members of the Red Guard attempted to sabotage the Yantai Hydrocarbon Plant, a major producer of petroleum for military vehicles, with what appears to be a series of makeshift explosive detonations. While no workers were killed, several on shift were injured and the plant will likely not be operational for at least another year. The mayor of Yantai is now calling for a crackdown on the Red Guards based there, and the damage to the plant has ruffled some feathers in both the PLA and the local CCP committee which was in part responsible for managing the factory. While cracking down on the Yantai Red Guards would likely pacify the PLA and local government, it could lead to repeat acts by Red Guards elsewhere."
 PRC.8.a:0 "Round up the Red Guards that might be responsible."
 PRC.8.b:0 "A victory for true Maoists not shackled by capitalist sins!"
 PRC.9.t:0 "Standoff Over Qiao Shi"
 PRC.9.desc:0 "Qiao Shi has been a vocal opponent of Zhang Chunqiao's Second Cultural Revolution, and recently humiliated Zhang by likening the revolution to a \"\yet another civil war\"\. Qiao has since been removed from his position as Minister of Foriegn Affairs and is being held at his residence by a group of party assigned body guards. However, at 9:45 AM this morning two men opened fire on Qiao Shi's residence. While Qiao Shi appears to be unharmed, the general concensus is that the attack was carried out by Red Guards as retalliation for his speech at the last committee meeting. Furthermore, a large group of Red Guards has arrived outside Qiao's residence demanding he be turned over, and some fear that if their demands are not met they will attack in an attempt to seize him. Agreeing to this would effectively grant the Red Guard power over CCP members, many of whom agree it is finally time to show once and for all that the Red Guard, and potentially even their political supporters be put in their place. Doing so would signal a massive power shift in the CCP and could potentially even lead to the dismissal of the current party leadership, including Zhang himself."
 PRC.9.a:0 "We must put an end to this Red Guard menance once and for all!"
 PRC.9.b:0 "The current party structure must be upheld, even if it means caving into the Red Guards."
 PRC.10.t:0 "The End of the Revolution"
 PRC.10.desc:0 "Discontent has been brewing amongst the Red Guard for some time over the frequent supression of their activities, and the refusal to turn over Qiao Shi appears to have been the last straw. Red Guards instigated riots in various major cities, although fear of retalliation by the PLA has kept their turnout to a minimum. Things were made worse when Zhang Chunqiao made a speech in favor of the riots in which he likened them to \"\a class struggle in its finest form in which the corupt elders who run this country will finally perish\"\. Outraged, CCP leadership has acted swiftly in self-preservation and has held a vote to remove Zhang from his leadership posistion. The formerly disgraced Qiao Shi has been rehabillitated, and was choosen by the CCP to lead the nation towards a \"\far more stable and modern path\"\. While the rammifications of this series of events has not yet become apparent, it is likely safe to say that the Second Cultural Revolution has come to an end."
 PRC.10.a:0 "Perhaps we have finally learned from the mistakes of our past."
 PRC.11.t:0 "March on the New Great Hall of the People"
 PRC.11.desc:0 "Likely having been emboldened by the government kowtowing to their wishes, the Red Guards has marched on the New Great Hall of the People and have given the CCP and ultimatum. Among their demands is the resignation of many prominent CCP members to make way for Red Guard leaders and the incorpation of the Red Guard as an offical branch of the government, which will supposedly be in charge of ensuring the continuity of the Second Cultural Revolution. The Red Guards have garnered widespread support due to their gatherings and acts of violence over the last year, and if the rumors are true have armed themselves in preperation for their ultimatum being refused. With the CCP in a weakened posistion it seems that the Red Guard's demands will have to be fulfilled unless we wish to have yet another civil war."
 PRC.11.a:0 "We have more than enough enemies without fighting amongst ourselves."
 PRC.11.b:0 "Better another civil war than to submit to the Red Guards!"
 PRC.12.t:0 "Prominent Red Guards Inducted into CCP Leadership"
 PRC.12.desc:0 "In accordance with the Red Guard ultimatum accepted by the CCP, several prominent members of the Red Guard have been offically brought into the government. Among them is Wang Hongwen, know colloquially as the \"\Red Menace\"\, who has accepted a posistion as the newly created Chairman of the Red Guard; a posistion in which he will continue to lead the Red Guard, which has been transformed into a government organization. Wang gave a speech in which he praised the Second Cultural Revolution and called Zhang Chunqiao \"\Mao's best and most worthy choice for a sucessor\"\. While it seems the Second Cultural Revolution will not be ending anytime soon, by having offically incorporated the Red Guard into the government perhaps a degree of normalcy has been restored."
 PRC.12.a:0 "To the cultural revolution and the never ending class struggle!"
 PRC.13.t:0 "Civil War Within the People's Republic"
 PRC.13.desc:0 "Enraged by the CCP's decision to deny the Red Guard a place in the government, Red Guards throughout China have risen up in revolution against them. While they are not nearly as well armed as the PLA, they have fighting spirit and are much larger in number. While the CCP still holds Beijing due to the significant PLA presence there, the Red Guard has captured much of the area surrounding the city as well as much of the coastline along the Yellow Sea. If we do not act fast to crush this rebellion the Red Guards may be able to secure victory, or even worse our enemies could see our weakness and decide to strike."
 PRC.13.a:0 "The Red Guard is feeble and will be crushed by the mighty republic."
 PRC.14.t:0 "Chinese Workers Union Invasion"
 PRC.14.desc:0 "The dishonorable Union traitors have decided to seize upon our moment of weakness to strike, breaking the armstance that has been in effect for over a decade. While extensive planning for this eventuality had taken place, it did not forsee a civil war which would place us in a much weaker state. Union troops have poured across our mutual border, and it now appears that they have been closely monitoring our political situation and had been preparing this attack for a while. Although grim, it is entirely possible that the Union will be able to crush both us and the Red Guard in one swift blow."
 PRC.14.a:0 "Will we be able to survive the Union's onslaught?"
 PRC.15.t:0 "Victory over the Red Guard"
 PRC.15.desc:0 "At long last we have triumphed over the traitorous Red Guards that sought to destroy all that Mao and those that follow him have created. While pockets of resistance remain in the countryside, any form of organizaned reistance has been crushed and those who supported the Red Guards have either been detained or wisely changed their loyalties. Wang Hongwen, considered by many to be the mastermind behind this rebellion, was found dead in a rebel encapment in Changchun, where he had apparently hid once the war began to turn against him. While the exact cause of death is unknown, the offical narrative is that even his most loyal fellow Guards had grown disenfranchised with the cause, and by killing him hoped to prove their newfound loyalty to the CCP. While the internal threats may have been subdued, enemies still remains on all sides and the Republic must remain vigilant lest it be felled during the reconstruction that must now ensue."
 PRC.15.a:0 "Glory to the Republic, the true adherents of Maoism!"
 PRC.16.t:0 "Taiyuan Trials"
 PRC.16.desc:0 "With almost total popular support Zhang Chunqiao could be said to have suceeded in his goal of having a Second Cultural Revolution. Despite this, in Zhang's eyes enemies still remain within the CCP who while loyal now, may jump at a chance to ensure his downfall. Acting on this fear, Zhang ordered the arrest of several prominent CCP officals including Zhang's old ally Yao Wenyuan. He, alongside some other party members, have been transported from Beijing to the city of Taiyuan where it appears that Zhang intends to have them subjected to a series of show trials, likely intended to humiliate them and to give him a cause to remove them from politics for good. While it is doubtful that there are truly any usupers remaining after the purges that have taken place over the previous years, it may not hurt to eliminate any remaining opposition. On the other hand, Bo has proved his loyalty to the part so far, and disposing of him upset other members of the CCP."
 PRC.16.a:0 "Find Yao guilty and sentence him to house arrest."
 PRC.16.b:0 "Yao his proved his loyalty, the CCP must prevent Zhang from disposing of him."
 PRC.17.t:0 "March of the Exiles"
 PRC.17.desc:0 "Following the recent change in leadership in top CCP posistions, former CCP chairman Zhang Chunqiao and his close allies's fates have remained up in the air. That all changed when after a dramatic 9-day long trial Zhang and his compatriots were found guilty of high treason. In order to not overly agitate the portions of the populace still loyal to Zhang, his sentence of death was commuted to one of exile. That sentence was carried out this morning when Zhang, fellow political allies, and some of the most devout of the Red Guard set out into the Gobi desert; likely never to be seen again. Some have likened the event to the Long March undertaken by Mao over five decades ago, and while it may be an apt comparison unlike then there will be no triumphant return for these exiles."
 PRC.17.a:0 "Ironic, isn't it?"
 PRC.18.t:0 "A New Central Committee"
 PRC.18.desc:0 "The plot lead by General Li Yuan was finally put into action when a series of arrests took place involving top CCP officals; including Zhang Chunqiao, Qiao Shi, and Hua Guofeng; took place shortly before the Central Committee's meeting scheduled for later today. While the exact fate of these detainees is unknown, it is rumored that they have been detained inside the PLA's Beijing Garrison headquaters. With the CCP in chaos, Liu Yuan arrived at the New Great Hall of the people and announced that the current Central Committee had been dismissed and that a new one will be choosen that is \"\more pragmatic and able to keep up with the changing times\"\. The members of the new Central Committee is still a subject of debate amongst the coup members, but as the center of the government the committee must be reseated as soon as possible. Currently the two options with the most support are a committee staffed by those in the army loyal to Liu Yuan's reformist cause, or a group of reformist politicans who had previously been removed from politics. There is also a small faction of the most hardline Liu supporters that believe he should rule alone, and that a new committee is not nessecary for the government to function, and while possible this is likely to cause issues in the future."
 PRC.18.a:0 "Liu's roots were in the army, and he should reward those who nurtured him."
 PRC.18.b:0 "There's a reason generals aren't politicans, rehabilliate the reformists."
 PRC.18.c:0 "There is no need for another committee, let Liu rule alone."
 PRC.19.t:0 "Reunification with the People's Republic of China"
 PRC.19.desc:0 "Top officals were suprised when a messanger arrived from the Republic which proposed negotiations involving the reunification of our nation with with their own. These negotiations seem to have been the brainchild of the new chairman of the Republic, Liu Yuan, who informants had characterized as a reformist. Regardless, this comes as a welcome suprise, as both sides seek a united China, preferably not through conflict. If we accept these terms, the negotiations will occur in the coming weeks, and hopefully full reunification will follow. While this seems to many to be a best case scenario, some higher-ups in the government are reluctant to reunify; likely due to distrust formed during the Second Chinese Civil War. If we are to reunify this faction must be convinced it is the right choice. On the other hand, perhaps the old guard has a valid point afterall."
 PRC.19.a:0 "Inform the messanger that we will attend these negotiations."
 PRC.19.b:0 "The old guard is right, once a Maoist always a Maoist!"
 PRC.20.t:0 "Reunification Negotiations"
 PRC.20.desc:0 "Delegates from both the Union and our own republic arrived at the Hall of Great Harmony in Beijing to discuss the terms of reunification. The delegations were first treated to a luncheon where state media was allowed to take photos and get remarks, and afterwards the delegations moved to a private confrence room for the negotiations proper. The Union delegates have given a list of terms that must be met in order to reunify which includes\:\ the integration of Union officals into the CCP and PLA, amnesty for all Union citizens who up until now were considered criminals, and a stimulus package for the provinces that would have previously comprised the Union. Afterwards the Union delegation retired to their quaters while our delegation meet with CCP officals, including Chairman Liu, to determine our next course of action. While the terms may be considerd humiliating by some members of the CCP, most agree that they are worth accepting in order to achieve reunification. Liu announced that once he and his advisors come to a concensus, he will announce their decision to the Union delegation personally."
 PRC.20.a:0 "The price is worth it for a China reunited."
 PRC.20.b:0 "As always, the Union dogs have played us for a fool! Deny the terms!"
 PRC.21.t:0 "People's Republic of China Agrees to Reunification Terms"
 PRC.21.desc:0 "Liu Yuan, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, announced to our delegation that they would accept our terms for reunification. The Workers Congress met for a final time today where they offically declared that the Chinese Workers Union had seized to exist, and that the territory that comprised it would be integrated into the People's Republic of China. While it seems strange that the divide which so violently tore China apart could be resolved peacefully, it is perhaps as close to a happy ending as we can get."
 PRC.21.a:0 "China shall be whole again once more!"
 PRC.22.t:0 "People's Republic of China Refuses Reunification Terms"
 PRC.22.desc:0 "Liu Yuan, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, announced to our delegation that they would not accept our terms for reunification. This comes as a shock to many in the Union who had hoped for a peaceful resolution to the conflict between our two nations. Unfortunately, it seems peace is no longer an option, as the Republic is intent on completely destroying us just as they tried to do a few decades prior. The Workers Congress had met, likely planning to finalize the reunification, but upon hearing of the Republic's betrayal issued a statement in which they reaffirmed their committment to the worker's struggle against the treacherous Maoist elements that caused this division in the first place."
 PRC.22.a:0 "We should have expected nothing less from the Maoists."
 PRC.23.t:0 "Chinese Reunification Realized"
 PRC.23.desc:0 "The Chinese Workers Union's governing body, the Workers Congress, announced today that the Union had siezed to exist, and is now offically part of the People's Republic of China. While it will be some time before the governments and armies of our two nations are fully unified, people across our nation have begun to celebrate. Chairman Liu gave a speech outside the New Great Hall of the People which was attended by an estimated ten-thousand people, and a massive celebration followed. Similar celebrations are taking place throughout the country, from Beijing to Chongqing, and it seems that the divisions that began with the start of the Second Chinese Civil War over fifty years ago have finally begun to fade into the past."
 PRC.23.a:0 "China is united once more!"
 PRC.24.t:0 "Conflict Along the Gansu Line"
 PRC.24.desc:0 "Despite the signing of the Chongqing Ceasefire in 1980, tensions still run high along our border with the Chinese Workers Union. The border is heavily militarized, and reports of harassment by Union soilders are frequently reported, although the tension has been very small-scale and any major conflicts have been prevented. That changed today when the 167th rifle platoon engaged in live-round fire with Union forces, leaving several dead on both sides and even more wounded. The 167th platoon was stationed along the Gansu Line, a series of forts on the Union border which are considered the first line of defense against a Union offensive. The fighting took place over the course of of an hour until a major from the nearby 214th platoon could arrive to halt to fighting. This has greatly increased tensions between ourselves and the Union, and if more incidents like these follow it is fully possible that such engagements could lead to a full-scale war."

 PRC.25.t:0 "Union Soilders Cross into Republican Territory"
 PRC.25.desc:0 "Conflict has broken out once again along our border with the Union over what appears to be a accidential route deviation by Union mechanized forces. The flatter areas of the border are often patrolled by a combination of motorized, mechanized, and sometimes even armored forces as an intimidation tactic. It appears that in this case, a Union mechanized batallion crossed the border after their navigator made read a map incorrectly and somehow crossed the border into our territory without being seen. The batallion ran into the 25th and 39th rifle companies who were conducting a joint training exercise, and assuming it was a Republican invasion, attacked the platoons. While our soilders fought bravely, they were no match for the mechanized troops and it is estimated over 83 of our men died in the conflict, along with 51 Union troops and two destroyed IFVs. The fighting was finally stopped when a Union scout helicopter located the missing batallion and called off the attack, but the damage had already been done. Many in the CCP are now calling for war with the Union, and should another incident like this occur we may have no choice but to agree to their demands."

 PRC.26.desc:0 "Named after the fir trees that line the ridge where the fighting took place, a massive border conflict, dubbed the Battle of Fir Ridge, took place yesterday and is the largest conflict between the People's Republic of China and Chinese Workers Union since the Second Chinese Civil War. While reports about the battle are still coming in, it appears the 86th infantry brigade engaged the Union's 322 infantry brigade. Both sides were already jumpy after the other recent border conflicts, and it appears a single misfire is all it to drive them to conflict. While the Union soilders were able to take much of the ridge, our forces managed to entrench themselves at the top until air support could be called in to disperse the Union soilders, who under heavy arial fire retreated down the ridge and deeper into the Chinese Workers Union where our pilots could not persue them. With casualties on both sides in the hundreds, many in the CCP see this as a declaration of war and now wish to execute a counterattack. Union diplomats have yet to inform us of what the rammifications of this battle are, and it now seems that if we do not strike now they will follow up to skirmish with a full-scale invasion."

While neither side claims to be the agressor, and pins the blame on the slew of border conflicts that took place over the past year, the resumption of hostilities should not come as a suprise to anyone closely follow the situation. The divide between the two is rooted in a deeper ideological struggle, and while there was some hope that these difference could be put aside with the talks that took place in the late 1980s, it has now become evident that this will never be the case. Any differences that the Union and the Republic have will be settled through conflict, and the ensuing war is sure to pull the rest of China into its midst before it ends."

A group of said Chinese recently returned to the republic where they described the horrific of the rituals that took place, which outraged members of the CCP. Now many are are calling for diplomatic pressure to be put on Pelvin and his followers at the very least, and perhaps even more violent action. While we have maintained semi-formal relations with Nirvana since its formation, making any real diplomatic progress is difficult and it will be a challenge to get an concessions involving the return of the rest of our citizens."

However, recently a few Chinese refugees fled the back to the Republic, and are now claiming that we tortured them and other devious lies. This had led to the Republican diplomats demanding we return all Chinese living in our country, \"\unless we are willing to stand up to the might of the People's Liberation Army\"\.
