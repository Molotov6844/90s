 PRC.1.t:0 "Prominent Union Renegades Caught at Border"
 PRC.1.desc:0 "A border patrol was suprised when at around 11 PM last night a convoy of people attempted to cross the border in a retrofitted technical. While refugees from the Union are common due to the abhorrent conditions of those living there, it soon became apparent that these were no ordinary refugees. Upon arriving in Beijing under escort from trusted PLA members it was revealed that the refugee groups consisted of several major members of the Union's upper echelon, including Zhang Dejiang, the Chairman of Infastructure and Housing; Zhang Lianzhong, who was previously considered the Union's lead admiral; and Deng Xiaoping, a founder of the Union who while officaly having retired from politics still held a lot of political sway. While the exact reason that these people attempted to enter our nation has yet to be ascetained, this is sure to shock and humiliate the Union."
 PRC.1.a:0 "We will have to wait and see how this situation develops."
 PRC.2.t:0 "The Fate of the Renegades"
 PRC.2.desc:0 "Since their arrival in Beijing the Union refugees have been kept under close surveillance both to prevent their escape and for their own saftey. Against the wishes of othe party members, Zhang Chunqiao expressed his intent to have the refugees, dubbed renegades by the masses, tried for high treason. At the trial the renegades were made to read prepared speeches containing Maoist propaganda, although Deng Xiaoping deviated from his assigned speech and was forcibly removed from the courtroom. After several hours of largely theatrical proceedings, it has now come down to the judge to decide to adequate punishment, which will likely align with the wishes of the CPC."
 PRC.2.a:0 "Having been found guilty of high treason, the renegades are sentenced to death!"
 PRC.2.b:0 "It is best not to strain tensions with the Union too much, life imprisonment will suffice for now."
 PRC.2.c:0 "We must not upset the careful balance in the region, return the renegades to the Union."
 PRC.3.t:0 "Red Guard Demonstration Outside the Forbidden City"
 PRC.3.desc:0 "Thousands of Red Guards have gathered outside the Forbidden City to espouse their support for Mao Zedong. While Red Guard demonstrations are common, they often are points of tension between themselves and the army. The demonstration took a violent turn when Red Guard members entered the Forbidden City, which has stood since 1420 as a symbol of the glory days of the Chinese Empire and was repurposed as a museum in 1925, and began to destroy the palace grounds in the name of Mao. Outraged, citizens of Beijing and members of the People's Liberation Army's Beijing Garrison have arrived at the palace to stop the Guards. However, the Red Guards are an unoffical extension of the CPC and supressing their demonstration is bound to cause issues in the future."
 PRC.3.a:0 "The Forbidden City is an important part of our history and must be preserved!"
 PRC.3.b:0 "Hurrah for the Red Guard! The grand symbol of the cruel emperors has finally been destroyed!"
 PRC.4.t:0 "Zhang Chunqiao Proclaims the Second Cultural Revolution"
 PRC.4.desc:0 "A air of fear has descended onto the CPC, and by extension the rest of the People's Republic when Zhang Chunqiao make an unexpected speech from the New Great Hall of the People (the old Great Hall having been destroyed in the nuclear blast that struck parts of Beijing in 1976). In the speech Zhang called for \"\a grave need to restructure Chinese society\"\ and to \"\crush the roots of capitalism that have once again taken hold\"\ He likened his request to the Cultural Revolution started by Mao decades earlier, and said that while it was largely sucessful, it had become apparent that a second one was needed. Already an issue, this new proclamation will likely put the Red Guard into a revolutionary fevor, and ordinary citizen and CPC member alike ought to be concerned over their saftey. While it may have a seemingly innocuous goal, Zhang will likely follow in Mao's footsteps and use the chaos as an opportunity to purge his political supporters and opponets alike."
 PRC.4.a:0 "It seems history truly is doomed to repeat itself."
 PRC.5.t:0 "Red Guard Members Gather in Shenyang"
 PRC.5.desc:0 "A large congregation of Red Guard members has gathered in central Shenyang. Among them is Wang Hongwen, a prominent member of the Red Guard who many believe is responsible for the orgination of the often violent protests conducted by the Red Guard. While the gathering is offically for a speech on the Second Cultural Revolution to be given by Wang, rumors have surfaced that Wang means to call for the arrest of various CPC members who he sees as detrimental to the revolution. While this could potentially be benefical, this would be a major increase in the Red Guard's power and could lead to issues in the future."
 PRC.5.a:0 "The are for the revolution are they not, why should we stop them?"
 PRC.5.b:0 "A rouge group like the Red Guards can not be allowed that degree of power."
 PRC.6.t:0 "People's Liberation Army Clashes with the Red Guard"
 PRC.6.desc:0 "Since the armstance signed in 1980 PLA divisons that fought in the civil war have been garrisoned in major cities to attempt to provide some degree of order. However, this has caused tensions with the increasingly militarized Red Guards who see the PLA as helping to aid in supressing the revolution. Ill will between the two has been festering for some time, and it manifested itself earlier today when the PLA forcibly supressed a Red Guard assembly. While no one appears to have been killed, several Red Guards appear to have been injured, and Red Guard leadership has called for the arrest of those responsible. This has put the CPC in an awkward posistion as the army is crucial to maintaining their rule, but if the Red Guard's demands are not met it could turn them against the government."
 PRC.6.a:0 "The soilders responsible must be detained along with their commanding officer."
 PRC.6.b:0 "We need the PLA's loyalty now more than ever, sweep this incident under the rug."
 PRC.7.t:0 "Qingdao Massacre"
 PRC.7.desc:0 "Tensions between the PLA and Red Guard have taken a turn for the worse after a violent confrentation during a Red Guard rally last night. Due to an estimated five thousand Red Guards having showed up for a series of speeches, including ones by Wang Hongwen and even Zhang Chunqiao himself; the mayor of Beijing requested PLA support to control the Guards. Vastly outnumbered by the Red Guard, it can be assumed that the PLA soliders were likely already jumpy, and it seems that they were ill prepared to mantain order admist such a large gathering of people. While it is uncertain as to what was the exact cause, a PLA soldier fired off a shot into the crowd, and the rest of the batallion followed. The Red Guards gathered there quickly dispersed, but it is estimated that at least 51 were killed and 186 injured along with three soilders being badly burned by a molotov cocktail thrown in retaliation. Both Wang and Zhang were safely escorted off the premises, and now Wang is calling for the CPC to take drastic action and \"\enact a sentence dishonorable death\"\ towards those responsible lest he \"\call upon his fellow revolutionaries to defend the ideals of Mao against the PLA menace\"\."
 PRC.7.a:0 "Execute the soldiers responsible."
 PRC.7.b:0 "Imprision the batallion as an example, but do not agree to Wang's demands."
 PRC.7.c:0 "The Red Guard are the ones at fault! Their cries for blood fall on deaf ears!"
