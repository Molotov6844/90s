POLITICS_MICHAEL_DUKAKIS_DESC:0 "Michael Dukakis was born on November 3rd, 1933, to a pair of well-off doctors who had immigrated to America in 1912. A mere college kid at the young age of 27 when the bombs went off. Like all college, kids, Dukakis was a staunch supporter of President Eisenhower, and despised Patton, Wallace, and Ford for their betrayl of America during the collapse. It was the combination of this bitter hatred and a gifted intellect that won Dukakis his House seat in 1961, by then a respected and competant physican, awell as member of the community. While a Representitive, Dukakis urged the passing of the Federal Electrification bill, being hailed as one of the founding members of the Federal Electrification Agency, or FEA. It was when the people of Massachusetts finally had light in there homes that won him his Governor seat in 1966. As Governor, Dukakis became what can essentially be called the Messiah of Massachusetts, as his policies created a standard of life unparralled in that state since the collapse, with not only Electricity, but televisons and phone lines. After 20 years of incredibly managment, Dukakis was able to get the republician nomination for the President of the United, and then the President. As Dukakis nears his first term, things have begun to look up, the FEA was expanded to not only include the Urban hubs like New York and Philaedelphia, but to a majority of the American coastline, including Norfolk. Water treatment was first re-introduced to New York and Philaedelphia in 1988, and since then Dukakis seeks to expand to all of America. When asked about his personal ideology, he simply responded with \"American\". In foreign policy Dukakis seeks to §Rreunify the nation at all costs, and is willing and hoping to force the traitors that stole America to come to heel.§!. He has not come without oppisition however, as the SDPA has critized his Federal Administrations as being Anti-Worker, with them being little better than the old companies that preceded them, but so far their critisisms have fallen on death. As the 1992 election comes to ahead, it seems all but ensured that Dukakis wins the next election, but things have been shown to change very rapidly before..."
